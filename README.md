# backbone
## What is backbone?
Lightweight, ECS-like package for Flame and Flutter. Backbone doesn't seek to replace the component system in Flame, it extends it by ECS patterns.

## Is it ready for production?
*No*, we are still working on this package, currently we are using it in a not yet announced project.

## What does backbone do for me?
It helps you to organize and structure features of your game and still use the many great features Flame ships. With backbone you can also increase the reusability of code.

## Can I use backbone beside the existing component system?
Yes! Backbone doesn't try to replace the component system at all. You can see it as an addition/upgrade to it.

## Is it only something for new projects?
No! You can add backbone to any Flame game and use it alongside the existing components.
